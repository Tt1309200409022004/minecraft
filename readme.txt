As of November 2024, Minecraft 1.16.5, Pixelmon Reforged version 9.1.12, will be the final version of the map. There have been issues with chunk errors ever since I started working on the map in 2019, and over time this has caused file corruption in the save file. In 1.20, the map will not load due to how worlds are loaded/saved, and Minecraft gives an error saying it will not load. I have used the "Minecraft Region Fixer" python tool in the past with success. However, the chunk errors always come back. These chunk errors can be visually observed in game by looking at the ocean floor between the Jungle island and the Fairy/Flower island. Physical chunks are being switched around on save. I believe this to be a symptom of the file corruption, and is not related to the cause. I believe the cause is just from the insane amount of Pixelmon NPCs, blocks, items, entities, etc... that the world has to save each time. To reduce possible save corruption, try not to play with the "Open to LAN" setting turned on. Maybe in the future, someone will make a better Pixelmon map. I highly doubt it though, thanks BzUrQ
